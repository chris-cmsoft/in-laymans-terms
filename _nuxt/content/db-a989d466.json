with programs, and programs would be pretty useless if we could not communicate them.\n\nFor example, when you open Twitter, it uses an API to fetch all of the tweets which are available for you to see.\n\nIt will In Layman's Terms, ask the API \"Please give me all of the tweets\", \nand the API will respond with a list of Tweets which are relevant to you.\n\nHow it does that is unimportant,

remote is using an infrared API.\n\nWhen your keyboard talks to your computer, it uses a USB Interface.\n\nWhen your phone talks to Twitter, it uses an HTTP API.\n\nThere are a massive amount of

of calling an API from a browser, \nwhich does not match the original domain of the page currently loaded.\n\nFor example if one.com where to call two.com, we would say they are calling across origins (domains).\n\nThis is sometimes useful for example if a website uses google maps api to include an address search,\nit would need to call to maps.google.com. This would be a cross-origin request.\n\nWhen building an API though, we don't want websites which do not belong to us,\nor websites not supposed to use our API, to use our API freely from other domains.\n\nThis is where CORS comes in. \n\nWe can instruct the browser on which domains are allowed to be called.\n\nWhen the application makes a call to our API, \nwe return headers to tell the browser whether they can, or cannot call our API,\nas well as which headers and methods are allowed, and whether they are allowed to pass credentials.\n\nAPI's will usually use the `Origin` header to determine where a request is coming from, \nas the browser automatically constructs this header, and can be considered safe.\n\nAll of the instructions are passed back to the browser using headers.\n\n---\n## Preflight Requests\n\nBrowsers will often send a pre-flight request before calling the actual method requested. \n\nThese requests are made before the actual API call, using the `OPTIONS` method. \n\nThis allows the browser to check whether it can actually call your API, before sending any data.\n\nIt would be pointless sending sensitive data, before knowing whether it was allowed to.\n\nThese requests are usually very fast, and should not inhibit the browsers validation\n\n---\n## Response Headers \n\n```\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin:   \n```\n\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin controls which origins are allowed to call our API. \n\nIt's value can be a wildcard `*` to indicate that any website origin is allowed to call our API.\n\nThis header will often be populated with the origin calling the API after being validated by the server.\n\n```\nAccess-Control-Expose-Headers:\n``` \n\nAccess-Control-Expose-Headers controls which headers are allowed to be read by the browser from the response.\n\nIt can either be a wildcard `*`, or a comma separated list of header names.\n\nThis is useful if you would like to prevent websites you do not control, \nfrom reading for example `Set-Cookie` headers which contain sensitive tokens,\nand are stored and returned without Javascript being able to access the tokens.\n\n```\nAccess-Control-Max-Age:\n```\n\nAccess-Control-Max-Age controls how long the browser is allowed to cache or reuse one preflight request,\nbefore needing to send a new preflight request.\n\nThis helps prevent the browser from making a preflight request before every single API call.\n\n```\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: \n```\n\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials controls whether credentials are allowed to be passed to your API.\n\nIt can be set to `true` or omitted if false\n\n```\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods:\n```\n\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods controls which methods are allowed to be used to call your API.\n\nIt can be either a wildcard `*` or a list of methods comma-separated `GET, POST, PUT`,\n\n```\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers:\n``` \n\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers controls which headers the user can send along with the request.\n\nEither a wildcard `*` or a list of methods comma-separated `X_SOME_HEADER, X-ANOTHER-HEADER`.\n","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/cors","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-07-16T15:43:41.009Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-16T15:43:41.009Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1626450287390},"$loki":5},{"slug":"domain","description":"A Domain is the \"address\" of your software","title":"Domain","categories":["api","web"],"author":{"slug":"chris"},"toc":[{"id":"not-to-be-confused-with-a-url","depth":2,"text":"Not to be confused with a URL"},{"id":"how-do-they-work-","depth":2,"text":"How do they work ?"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"A Domain name is a human-readable address for software, like "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://example.com","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"example.com"}]},{"type":"text","value":".\nIn this case example.com is your domain name."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Websites or APIs are hosted on some infrastructure (servers),\nand these all have IP Addresses.\nBut IP Addresses can change, and are not easy to remember, and easy to type incorrectly."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"A Domain name is a human-friendly way to always point at your infrastructure,\nno matter if the IP address changes.

Now let's consider that we start seeing some scale. \n\nOur user base has grown and you need some more servers to handle the load. \nNot for all of the parts of your application, but only for certain parts.   \n\nLet's say for example the queue processors, and the API. \n\nSo we add a second server, deploy the code, hook it up to the Queue, \ndeploy the web server, and start processing extra background jobs and requests.\n\nWe also add a load balancer in front of our servers, \nso the load is split across all our servers for the API.\n\n![Traditional Server Layout](/content/kubernetes/ScaledTraditionalServer.png \"Traditional Server Layout\")\n\n### Updating a scaled traditional deployment \n\nWhen we now want to update our application, we need to ssh into each of our servers,\nupdate the codebase, and restart everything. \n\nOur updates are still fairly simple to manage, but we have to look after these servers. \n\nWhen we update server packages for security updates for example,\nwe need to install new packages, and reboot our servers. \n\nWe now have downtime included as well. We have a bit of time during our application updates and server reboots,\nwhere some of our application is not accessible. \n\n![Traditional Server Layout](/content/kubernetes/ScaledTraditionalServerUpdating.png \"Traditional Server Layout\")\n\n### Zero downtime updates in a scaled traditional deployment\n\nWe would not like to do application updates without downtime, \nso our application remains accessible throughout updates.\n\nSo we go ahead and add 1 more server, to replicate our first server,\nadd it to the load balancer. \n\nThen during updates, we remove the updating server from the load balancer,\nupdate and reboot it, and then add it back to the load balancer.\n\nWe need to do this for every server, keeping in mind that they might have different components,\nand that each server might need to be treated differently. \n\n![Traditional Server Layout](/content/kubernetes/ScaledTraditionalServerUpdatingWLB.png \"Traditional Server Layout\")\n\n### More applications\n\nAs our business keeps growing, we have more and more applications or APIs, or even microservices\nthat need to be deployed. So we reuse the infrastructure we have, and deploy these onto our existing servers\nto keep networking and server updates simple, and update our procedures for updating all the applications.\n\nWe now have a big jumble of apis deployed across our server fleet.  \n\nWe need a way to make the deployments simpler, as deploying one of our applications\nbrings downtime for our other applications which reside on the same machine.\n\n---\n\n## Containers\n\nSo we start packaging all of our applications in [Containers](/blog/container), \nto more easily manage their dependencies, hide implementation details from the server, \nand more easily update our applications on our servers.\n\nInstead of heaving to pull code and update packages and restart processes directly on the servers,\nwe can build each of these separately, and simply pull the new images onto the servers, update the configs,\nand restart the containers. \n\nThe only time we need to restart the servers, is when we have updates to the servers themselves.\n\n![Traditional Server Layout](/content/kubernetes/ScaledContainers.png \"Traditional Server Layout\")\n\n### Updating scaled container deployments\n\nWhen we want to update applications, we now need to SSH onto all of the servers where the application is running,\nand pull the new image for teh application, and restart the container for that particular application.\n\nThere are two things which are hard about this process. \n\nWe have to find only the servers where this application is running,  \nand we need to know the correct command and settings for the specific container.\n\nIf containers are sufficiently complex (Volumes, Networks, Port mappings), this process can be quite error prone.\n\n![Traditional Server Layout](/content/kubernetes/ScaledContainers.png \"Traditional Server Layout\")\n\n### Declarative configuration\n\nTo solve the error prone problem we have when updating containers, we use a method called declarative config.\n\nDeclarative configuration is where we specify all of the settings for the containers \nin a file. Usually this is a json or yaml file.\n\nIn this file, we can specify all of the volume mounts, networks, ports, images etc. \n\nWe can then use this file to keep our settings in, and update it before we run our new application.\n\nThis helps us avoid errors, as well as make it easy to review changes when we update the fie for new changes.\n\n![Traditional Server Layout](/content/kubernetes/ScaledContainersDeclarative.png \"Traditional Server Layout\")\n\n---\n\n## Orchestration\n\nWe still have the problem of having to copy declarative files to the correct servers,\nand running the new containers. \n\nThere is still a lot of manual effort involved, and this process could be easily automated.\n\n### Dynamic changes in traffic \n\nImagine we have scale that goes up and down, or applications that need more processing during the day, \nand queues that need more processing at certain times.\n\nFor the quiet times, we have too much processing power, and for busy times, \nwe sometimes have to move containers around to make sure there is enough processing power for everybody. \n\nIf a server gets too busy, we need to move some containers to other servers, which aren't as busy.\n\nIf a particular server starts failing, we need to make sure we reschedule the containers that were running there,\nto a new server, or to the servers which are all still healthy. \n\nAll of this takes a lot of manual effort.\n\n![Traditional Server Layout](/content/kubernetes/ScaledContainersDynamicOutage.png \"Traditional Server Layout\")\n\n### Networking for dynamic changes\n\nWhen we start moving applications around for different reasons, \nwe need to administer the load balancer to send traffic to the correct servers which have to correct applications.\n\n### Automated Health checks\n\nWhen we start implementing solutions like Health checks, or smoke tests, \nso we can automatically switch the load balancer to healthy servers, \nwe need to administer this to point it at all the available applications,\nas well as add and remove any applications which are no longer there or available.\n\nThis becomes a very big manual effort when you consider adding more automated checks or monitoring.\n\nUsually this will happen through some scripting which automatically gets triggered.\n\n![Traditional Server Layout](/content/kubernetes/ScaledContainersDynamicScripts.png \"Traditional Server Layout\")\n\n---\n\n## Kubernetes\n\nThis is where an orchestration tool like Kubernetes steps in.\n\nKubernetes is a tool, which allows us to update containers using an API, and declarative files,\nand manage all our applications much more simply.\n\n![Traditional Server Layout](/content/kubernetes/Kubernetes.png \"Traditional Server Layout\")\n\n### Containers \n\nAt the core of Kubernetes is containers. \nIt starts, stops, updates, and removes containers from a cluster of servers.\n\nIf you want an application deployed onto the servers, \nyou can ask Kubernetes to deploy a container onto your fleet of servers.\n\nKubernetes will then look through your servers, find which server is best for adding the container to,\nand run it there.\n\nYou can also ask Kubernetes to deploy for example, 5 replicas of your container,\nand it will find the best servers where your containers will fit,\nand create 5 containers for you on the appropriate servers.\n\n### Networking \n \nEarlier we spoke about having to update a load balancer to remove an updating application.\n\nKubernetes does this automatically too, \nby updating it's Endpoints to no longer include the updating containers IP,\nwhich in turn means it is no longer included in the pool of containers for the application.\n\nIt also sets up networking in such a way, that no matter which one of your servers you call, \nit will route your request to a server which has your application on it.\n\n### Rolling updates\n\nIf setup correctly, when Kubernetes updates your application, it will add the new container,\nwithout removing the previous container, update the networking which points at the container to include the new container,\nand remove the old container, and continue onto updating the next container.\n\nThis is referred to as a RollingUpdate.\n\n### Configuration\n\nKubernetes also has capabilities to specify your application configurations,\nand include them in your containers. This means that you don't need to make sure that \nyou configuration is available on all of your servers, but rather specify it once,\nand let Kubernetes take care of putting it in all the right places.\n\n### Secrets\n\nKubernetes has a secret system built in, by which you can semi-securely add secrets for your applications,\nlike database passwords, or application keys, without having to specify them in your declarative files.\n\n### Dynamic updates\n\nKubernetes has built in mechanisms to ensure your desired state is continually reconciled.\n\nThis means that if for example, one of your servers fails or goes offline, \nKubernetes will move all of the containers running on that server,\nto other servers which are healthy and have enough capacity to accept these new containers.\n\n### Scaling applications\n\nKubernetes allows you to easily scale up or down containers,\nby simply updating how many replicas you would like.\n\nKubernetes then takes care of adding more containers on your servers, \nor removing some of them if you've scaled down. \n\n---\n\n## Kubernetes explained\n\nAfter reading all of this, the term Container Orchestrator should make a lot more sense.\n\nKubernetes is exactly that. It is a Container Orchestrator. \nIt orchestrates containers onto many servers, taking into account networking, capacity, health of applications etc.\n\nIt takes the manual labor out of managing containers. It makes it easier to deploy your containers, \nwithout having to spend too much time administering the servers on which they run, or worrying about downtime,\nor Rolling Updates.\n\n![Traditional Server Layout](/content/kubernetes/KubernetesDeclarative.png \"Traditional Server Layout\")\n\n---\n\n## Misconceptions\n\n### Kubernetes handles incoming traffic \n\nThere is a misconception, especially for Kubernetes new comers, \nthat Kubernetes handles traffic which is destined for our applications. \n\nThis is not true. It uses Linux tools to direct traffic, but if our Kubernetes servers go down,\nand your workload servers stay up, your application will continue to work,\nbut you will no longer be able to make updates to your application.\n\n### Kubernetes will make your applications better\n\nNo. Kubernetes in and of itself, will do nothing to improve your applications.\n\nIt will however make it easier to update and roll out changes, \nwhich in turn frees up your time, so you can work on improving your application\n\n### Kubernetes will make your application more secure\n\nNo. Kubernetes by itself will do nothing to improve the security of your application,\nand will arguably make your infrastructure less secure if not setup correctly.\n\nKubernetes runs containers. Containers have many CVEs still popping up today. \nVMs are a long established technology, and by default, probably more secure. \n\nIf you do however make an active effort to understand the fundamentals of container security,\nand make sure to setup your Kubernetes clusters correctly with the correct security parameters,\nyou could very well speed up your Software Delivery process, and keep things secure at the same time.\n\n### Kubernetes will allow my application to scale better\n\nNo. If your application was not able to scale before Kubernetes, it will not scale after Kubernetes. \n\nIf however, your application could scale before, but it was a big effort to scale it,\nKubernetes can help you to more easily scale it, and even do it automatically if necessary.\n\nIf your scaling problems lie in your integration points like your database or upstream APIs,\nyour time might be better spent solving those issues first, before trying out Kubernetes\nfor it's scaling capabilities. \n\n### Kubernetes is easy\n\nDefinitely not. Kubernetes is more than a technology when you start considering it for your business.\n\nIt requires a big shift in culture and the most effort spent will be on the adoption of it,\nrather than running it. \n\nYou could make many many mistakes along the way, which will require a very involved effort,\nand it is not a silver bullet to your organisational problems. \n\n--- \n\n## Credits\n\nIcons made by <a href=\"https://www.freepik.com\" title=\"Freepik\">Freepik</a> from <a href=\"https://www.flaticon.com/\" title=\"Flaticon\">www.flaticon.com</a>\n","dir":"/articles","path":"/articles/kubernetes","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-07-16T15:43:41.009Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-16T15:43:41.009Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1626450287505},"$loki":9},{"slug":"platform","description":"A Platform is a suite of technologies, and tools provided to developers to deploy their applications on.","title":"Platform","categories":["api","web"],"author":{"slug":"chris"},"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"A platform is at its core, a suite of technologies and tools provided to developers to deploy their applications on,\nwithout them needing to manage all of the extra bits around their software, like infrastructure, networking etc."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"You can think of a platform sort of like Amazon for sellers.\nSellers put their products on the Amazon website,\nwithout thinking about all of the extra bits like drop-shipping, warehousing, deliveries, payments etc.\nAll of the extra bits are taken care of by Amazon.\nAll a seller needs to think about is the product they want to sell."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"That's what a platform does for developers.\nA platform provides software developers a place to put their code and run it,\nwithout thinking about all the underlying bits like networking, servers, monitoring, and so forth."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"For example, if you have a website, and you want the world to see it,\nyou can use Cloud Hosting to publish your website and point a "},{"type":"element","tag":"nuxt-link","props":{"to":"/blog/domain"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"domain"}]},{"type":"text","value":" name at it.\nYou don't need to worry about networking, server updates, server security etc.\nYou can simply upload your website code to the Cloud Hosting service,\nand they take care of the rest.
